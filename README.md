# FlappyBirdGame

A simple Flappy Bird clone built in Java using only the default Java libraries. This project helped me understand basic game mechanics, object-oriented design, and how to handle graphics and user input in Java.

## ðŸŽ® Features

- **Gravity Simulation**: The bird constantly falls unless the player taps to make it jump.
- **Collision Detection**: The game ends when the bird hits a pipe or the ground or ceiling.
- **Scoring System**: Score increases every time the bird successfully passes between pipes.
- **Random Pipe Generation**: Pipes are placed at random vertical positions to increase difficulty.
- **Basic Game Loop**: Manages the game timing, updates, and rendering using Javaâ€™s built-in tools.

## ðŸ§  What I Learned

- How to create a game loop
- Drawing graphics using `Graphics` and `JPanel`
- Handling input with Javaâ€™s event system
- Detecting collisions with bounding boxes (`Rectangle` class)
- Organizing code using object-oriented principles (e.g., classes for Bird, Pipes, GamePanel)

## ðŸ“‚ How to Run

1. **Download the JAR file**  
   Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/EthanGon/FlappyBirdGame/releases) section and download `FlappyBirdGame.jar`.
